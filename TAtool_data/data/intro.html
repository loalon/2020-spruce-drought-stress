Drought stress impacts seedling establishment, survival and whole-plant productivity. 
Molecular responses to drought stress have been most extensively studied in 
herbaceous species, mostly considering only aboveground tissues. Coniferous tree 
species dominate boreal forests, which are predicted to be exposed to more frequent 
and acute drought as a result of ongoing climate change. The associated impact at all 
stages of the forest tree life cycle is expected to have large-scale ecological and 
economic impacts. However, the molecular response to drought has not been 
comprehensively profiled for coniferous species.

<p>
We assayed the physiological and transcriptional response of Picea abies (L.) H. Karst 
seedling needles and roots after exposure to mild and severe drought. Shoots and 
needles showed extensive reversible plasticity for physiological measures indicative of 
drought response mechanisms, including changes in stomatal conductance (gs), shoot 
water potential and ABA (abscisic acid). In both tissues the most commonly observed 
expression profiles in response to drought were highly correlated with ABA levels.</p>
<p>
Still, root and needle transcriptional responses contrasted, with extensive root-specific 
downregulation of growth. Comparison between previously characterised A. thaliana 
drought-response genes and P. abies revealed both conservation and divergence of 
transcriptional response to drought. In P. abies, transcription factors belonging to the 
bZIP AREB/ABF (ABA Response Element Binding / ABRE Binding Factors) ABA-
dependent pathway had a more limited role.
</p>
<p>
These results highlight the importance of profiling both above- and below-ground 
tissues and provide a comprehensive framework to advance understanding of the 
drought response of P. abies. The results demonstrate that short term, severe drought 
induces severe physiological responses coupled to extensive transcriptome modulation 
and highlight the susceptibility of Norway spruce seedlings to such drought events.
